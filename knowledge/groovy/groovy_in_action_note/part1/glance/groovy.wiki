= 瞥一眼 groovy =

* declaring classes
{{{
class Book {
	private String title
	Book(String theTitle) {
		title = theTitle
	}
	getTitle() {
		return title
	}
}

方法不写访问修饰符就默认是 public 的, java 中默认不写是包内可见. groovy 想达到包内可见的权限可以用注解.

}}}
* using scripts
{{{
Scripts are text files, typically with an extension of *.groovy, that can be executed from
the command shell like this:

> groovy myfile.groovy

Note that this is very different from Java. In Groovy, you’re executing the source code!
An ordinary Java class is generated for you and executed behind the scenes. But from
a user’s perspective, it looks like you’re executing plain Groovy source code.
