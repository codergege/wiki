= 瞥一眼 groovy =

* declaring classes
{{{
class Book {
	private String title
	Book(String theTitle) {
		title = theTitle
	}
	getTitle() {
		return title
	}
}

方法不写访问修饰符就默认是 public 的, java 中默认不写是包内可见. groovy 想达到包内可见的权限可以用注解.

}}}
* using scripts
{{{
Scripts are text files, typically with an extension of *.groovy, that can be executed from
the command shell like this:

> groovy myfile.groovy

Note that this is very different from Java. In Groovy, you’re executing the source code!
An ordinary Java class is generated for you and executed behind the scenes. But from
a user’s perspective, it looks like you’re executing plain Groovy source code.
}}}
* groovy bean
{{{
- Generating the accessor methods
- Allowing simplified access to all JavaBeans (including GroovyBeans)
- Simplifying registration of event handlers together with annotations that declare
a property as bindable
}}}
* annotation
{{{
Groovy also uses annotations to mark code structures for special compiler handling.

@Immutable

A Groovy bean can be marked as immutable, which means that the class becomes final , all its fields become final , and you cannot change its state after construction.
}}}
* using grapes
{{{
- @Grab
 
@Grab('commons-lang:commons-lang:2.4')
import org.apache.commons.lang.ClassUtils
class Outer {
class Inner {}
}
assert !ClassUtils.isInnerClass(Outer)
assert ClassUtils.isInnerClass(Outer.Inner)

}}}
* handling text
{{{
- GString 
groovy 中可以用单引号或者双引号, 双引号可以使用占位符:

def nick = 'ReGina'
def book = 'Groovy in Action, 2nd ed.'
assert "$nick is $book" == 'ReGina is Groovy in Action, 2nd ed.'

}}}
